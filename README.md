# Alpha Effects (AFX)
A few QoL additions to [Alpha Frontier](https://github.com/carriontrooper/Alpha-Frontier) of personal taste.

Currently sporting some base textures. 

Doesn't seem to work atm as a mod. :/ Not with perm audio/visual either. Hmm!

Tiles here look like this, but transparencies don't really render in the browser:

Hex dimensions aren't perfect. This is stubbornly difficult to get correct. It'll do for now.

Intention is to eventually update map [Tranquility](https://github.com/hackedpassword/Nextgen-Maps/tree/main/maps).
